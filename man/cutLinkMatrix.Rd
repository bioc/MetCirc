\title{Create a cut LinkMatrix}
\usage{
cutLinkMatrix(LinkMatrix, type = c("all", "inter", "intra"))
}
\arguments{
\item{LinkMatrix}{matrix, that gives per each row 
information on linked features}

\item{type}{character, one of "all", "inter" or "intra"}
}
\value{
cutLinkMatrix returns a matrix that gives per each row 
information on linked features
}
\description{
Create a cut LinkMatrix
}
\details{
This function is used to cut features from LinkMatrix. If 
type = "all", LinkMatrix will not be changed; if type = "inter" the cut
LinkMatrix will only contain entries of links which are between groups and 
not inside groups; contrary to that, if type = "intra" the cut LinkMatrix 
will only contain entries of links which are inside groups and not between 
groups.

\examples{
data("binnedMSP", package = "MetCirc")
## use only a selection 
binnedMSP <- binnedMSP[c(c(1:20, 29:48, 113:132, 240:259)),]
similarityMat <- createSimilarityMatrix(binnedMSP)
linkMat <- createLinkMatrix(similarityMatrix = similarityMat, threshold = 0.5)
cutLinkMatrix(LinkMatrix = linkMat, type = "all")
