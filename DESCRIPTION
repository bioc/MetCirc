Description: MetCirc comprises a workflow to interactively explore 
  high-resolution MS/MS metabolomics data: create an MSP object, a 
  format for MS/MS library data, bin m/z values of precursors, calculate 
  similarity between precursors based on the normalised dot product and 
  visualise similarities in a circular layout. Within the interactive framework
  the user can annotate MS/MS features based on their similarity to 
  (known) related MS/MS features.
